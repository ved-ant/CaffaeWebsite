            During my journey preparing for the JEE, I encountered challenges in
            reaching out to students who had successfully cleared the exam and
            found myself grappling with the same issue of selecting the right
            college.</div>
            <br></br>
           <div className={stl.matter}> My desire to gain firsthand insights from current college
            students about their experiences motivated me. This need for
            personalized guidance became even more apparent when my aunt sought my
            advice on identifying reliable YouTubers amidst the overwhelming array
            of content, as she aimed to launch her own YouTube channel. These experiences led me to recognize a broader demand for trusted and
            individualized guidance. </div>
            <br> 
            </br>
            <div className={stl.matter}>This realization gave birth to the concept of
            Caffae â€“ a user-friendly platform that seamlessly connects individuals
            seeking guidance with experts. On Caffae, users can access
            personalized insights through simple phone calls, making the process
            of obtaining reliable information and advice effortless.</div>
